  The mammalian penis is an organ that plays a crucial role in sexual reproduction and is a characteristic feature of male individuals in most mammalian species. It is a complex structure with diverse forms across different mammals, reflecting the adaptations to various reproductive strategies and environmental factors.

# Introduction

The mammalian penis [@King2020] is composed of erectile tissue, mainly the corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum. These tissues become engorged with blood during sexual arousal, leading to erection. The urethra, a duct that carries urine and semen, runs through the penis. In males, the urethra serves both excretory and reproductive functions. The primary function of the penis is to deliver sperm into the female reproductive tract during sexual intercourse, facilitating fertilization of the egg. The structure and shape of the penis can vary significantly among species, reflecting adaptations to different reproductive strategies (@fig-hugh). The diversity in penile morphology among mammals is a result of evolutionary pressures and adaptations to specific mating behaviors and ecological niches. Some species have elaborate penile structures, such as the baculum (os penis), which provides structural support during copulation. Mammalian species exhibit considerable variability in penis size, shape, and features. This diversity is influenced by factors like mating systems, social structures, and the presence or absence of specific mating rituals. For example, some species may have a highly ornamented or spiky penis, possibly serving functions related to mate competition or sperm competition. Not all mammals have a penis bone, but some species possess a baculum. The baculum is a bone within the penis that provides additional support during copulation. Its presence or absence is often associated with reproductive strategies. Erection is a hydraulic process in which blood flows into the erectile tissues, causing the penis to become rigid. This mechanism is controlled by the autonomic nervous system. Understanding the diversity and adaptations of the mammalian penis contributes to our knowledge of reproductive biology, evolution, and the ecological context in which different species have evolved. Researchers continue to study the intricacies of penile anatomy and function across various mammalian taxa to gain insights into reproductive strategies and evolutionary processes.

# Materials and methods

## Data

Penis measurements (and self-reported data) from various sources across many countries and regions was downloaded from data.world (https://data.world; last accessed 2023-11-28).

## Statistical analysis

We used ggpubr v0.6.0 R package to perform and report statistical tests [@ggpubr].

# Results

First we analyzed the effect of penis measurement communication to penis size. We found that self reported penises were slightly bigger (@fig-psize).

```{r}
#| label: fig-psize
#| fig-cap: "Those sneaky bastards self-report bigger penis."
penis <- read_csv(here("data/penis_long_format.csv")) # try what happens if you remove here()
ggboxplot(penis, x = "Method", y = "length", add = "jitter")  +
  stat_compare_means() +
  labs(y = "Penis length, cm")
```



# Discussion
The perception and reporting of penis size can be influenced by several factors, and it's important to distinguish between actual physical measurements and subjective perceptions. Here are some reasons why some men may report a larger penis size:

1. **Social and Cultural Influences:**
   - Social and cultural factors play a significant role in shaping individuals' perceptions of body image, including penis size. Societal ideals and media representations may contribute to a desire for larger genitalia, leading some individuals to overestimate their own size.

2. **Self-Perception Bias:**
   - People's self-perception is subjective and can be influenced by factors such as self-esteem, body image, and personal experiences. Some individuals may perceive their genitals differently than they objectively measure.

3. **Measurement Methods:**
   - The accuracy of self-reported measurements can vary. Some men may measure their penis in a way that provides a larger result, either intentionally or due to measurement errors. This could include measuring from a different starting point or applying more pressure during measurement.

4. **Social Comparison:**
   - Individuals may compare themselves to others, and this comparison can influence how they perceive their own size. If someone believes that a larger size is socially desirable, they may be more likely to report a size that aligns with this perceived norm.

5. **Psychological Factors:**
   - Psychological factors, such as confidence and self-esteem, can influence the way individuals perceive and report their own characteristics, including penis size. A person with higher self-esteem might be more likely to report a positive self-image.

6. **Pressure to Conform:**
   - Societal pressures and expectations related to masculinity and sexual performance may contribute to a desire to present oneself in a way that aligns with perceived norms. This pressure could influence how individuals report their penis size.

It's important to note that there is a wide range of normal variations in penis size, and there is no standard or ideal size. Scientific studies have consistently shown that there is considerable diversity in penis size among men, and factors such as genetics and hormonal influences contribute to this variation.

In clinical research, accurate measurements are typically obtained by trained professionals using standardized methods. Self-reported measurements, on the other hand, may not always reflect objective reality. Additionally, the emphasis on penis size can sometimes lead to unrealistic expectations, contributing to body image concerns.

If individuals have concerns about their body image or penis size, it may be helpful to seek guidance from healthcare professionals or mental health experts who can provide accurate information and support.
