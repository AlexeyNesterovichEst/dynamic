\section*{Abstract}
The mammalian penis is an organ that plays a crucial role in sexual
reproduction and is a characteristic feature of male individuals in most
mammalian species. It is a complex structure with diverse forms across
different mammals, reflecting the adaptations to various reproductive
strategies and environmental factors.

\section*{Author summary}
Some men report bigger appendages than other, suggesting that size does
matter.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

The mammalian penis \citep{King2020} is composed of erectile tissue,
mainly the corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum. These tissues become
engorged with blood during sexual arousal, leading to erection. The
urethra, a duct that carries urine and semen, runs through the penis. In
males, the urethra serves both excretory and reproductive functions. The
primary function of the penis is to deliver sperm into the female
reproductive tract during sexual intercourse, facilitating fertilization
of the egg. The structure and shape of the penis can vary significantly
among species, reflecting adaptations to different reproductive
strategies (Fig.~\ref{fig-hugh}). The diversity in penile morphology
among mammals is a result of evolutionary pressures and adaptations to
specific mating behaviors and ecological niches. Some species have
elaborate penile structures, such as the baculum (os penis), which
provides structural support during copulation. Mammalian species exhibit
considerable variability in penis size, shape, and features. This
diversity is influenced by factors like mating systems, social
structures, and the presence or absence of specific mating rituals. For
example, some species may have a highly ornamented or spiky penis,
possibly serving functions related to mate competition or sperm
competition. Not all mammals have a penis bone, but some species possess
a baculum. The baculum is a bone within the penis that provides
additional support during copulation. Its presence or absence is often
associated with reproductive strategies. Erection is a hydraulic process
in which blood flows into the erectile tissues, causing the penis to
become rigid. This mechanism is controlled by the autonomic nervous
system. Understanding the diversity and adaptations of the mammalian
penis contributes to our knowledge of reproductive biology, evolution,
and the ecological context in which different species have evolved.
Researchers continue to study the intricacies of penile anatomy and
function across various mammalian taxa to gain insights into
reproductive strategies and evolutionary processes.

\hypertarget{data}{%
\subsection{Data}\label{data}}

Penis measurements (and self-reported data) from various sources across
many countries and regions was downloaded from data.world
(https://data.world; last accessed 2023-11-28).

\hypertarget{statistical-analysis}{%
\subsection{Statistical analysis}\label{statistical-analysis}}

We used ggpubr v0.6.0 R package to perform and report statistical tests
\citep{ggpubr}.

\hypertarget{results}{%
\section{Results}\label{results}}

First we analyzed the effect of penis measurement communication to penis
size. We found that self reported penises were slightly bigger
(Fig.~\ref{fig-psize}).

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

The perception and reporting of penis size can be influenced by several
factors, and it's important to distinguish between actual physical
measurements and subjective perceptions. Here are some reasons why some
men may report a larger penis size:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Social and Cultural Influences:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Social and cultural factors play a significant role in shaping
    individuals' perceptions of body image, including penis size.
    Societal ideals and media representations may contribute to a desire
    for larger genitalia, leading some individuals to overestimate their
    own size.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Self-Perception Bias:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    People's self-perception is subjective and can be influenced by
    factors such as self-esteem, body image, and personal experiences.
    Some individuals may perceive their genitals differently than they
    objectively measure.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Measurement Methods:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The accuracy of self-reported measurements can vary. Some men may
    measure their penis in a way that provides a larger result, either
    intentionally or due to measurement errors. This could include
    measuring from a different starting point or applying more pressure
    during measurement.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Social Comparison:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Individuals may compare themselves to others, and this comparison
    can influence how they perceive their own size. If someone believes
    that a larger size is socially desirable, they may be more likely to
    report a size that aligns with this perceived norm.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Psychological Factors:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Psychological factors, such as confidence and self-esteem, can
    influence the way individuals perceive and report their own
    characteristics, including penis size. A person with higher
    self-esteem might be more likely to report a positive self-image.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Pressure to Conform:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Societal pressures and expectations related to masculinity and
    sexual performance may contribute to a desire to present oneself in
    a way that aligns with perceived norms. This pressure could
    influence how individuals report their penis size.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

It's important to note that there is a wide range of normal variations
in penis size, and there is no standard or ideal size. Scientific
studies have consistently shown that there is considerable diversity in
penis size among men, and factors such as genetics and hormonal
influences contribute to this variation.

In clinical research, accurate measurements are typically obtained by
trained professionals using standardized methods. Self-reported
measurements, on the other hand, may not always reflect objective
reality. Additionally, the emphasis on penis size can sometimes lead to
unrealistic expectations, contributing to body image concerns.

If individuals have concerns about their body image or penis size, it
may be helpful to seek guidance from healthcare professionals or mental
health experts who can provide accurate information and support.
